# Directory-Map

Directory Map is a program which lists the files and folders nested in a particular directory for visualisation purposes. 

Although File Explorer and Finder are multi-functional programs which far exceed the scope of this project, I have always found it unnecessarily difficult to search through the folders in a particular directory since only one folder can be displayed at one time. Directory Map lists all files and folders simultaneously which makes searching for a particular item significantly easier. 

Current features:
 - List all subfolders and files for a given directory. Subfolders and their items are indented depending on how deeply nested they are which allows for easier visualisation.
 - Save list to a .txt file so that multiple maps can be opened simultaneously, shared, or stored for later use.
